# 🚀 Running Performance Tests Locally - Quick Guide

## ⚡ Quick Start (Easiest Way)

I've created a simplified script for you. Just run:

```bash
# From the project root
# Set the API key first
export WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key

# Run the quick test
./quick-perf-test.sh
```

This will:
- ✅ Use your API key from the environment
- ✅ Run a quick 30-second test with 5 users
- ✅ Open the HTML report when done

---

## 🔧 Alternative: Direct Maven Commands

If the script doesn't work, run these commands directly:

### 1. Set the API Key (REQUIRED - Must be done first!)
```bash
export WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

⚠️ Important: The API key MUST be set as an environment variable BEFORE running the test. The performance tests require it to be available at runtime.

### 2. Run the Performance Test
```bash
mvn gatling:test \
  -Dgatling.simulationClass=com.example.performance.simulations.WeatherApiPerformanceSimulation \
  -Dperf.users=5 \
  -Dperf.rampup=5 \
  -Dperf.duration=30 \
  -Dperf.type=load
```

### 3. View the Report
```bash
open target/gatling-results/*/index.html
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "WEATHER_API_KEY is not set"
**Error Message:** `IllegalStateException: WEATHER_API_KEY is not set. Please set it as an environment variable or system property.`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Set it in your current terminal session (MUST DO THIS FIRST!)
export WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key

# Verify it's set
echo $WEATHER_API_KEY

# Then run the test
mvn gatling:test -Dgatling.simulationClass=com.example.performance.simulations.WeatherApiPerformanceSimulation
```

**Permanent Setup (optional):**
```bash
# Add to your ~/.zshrc for convenience
echo 'export WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Verify
echo $WEATHER_API_KEY
```

### Issue 2: "Permission denied"
**Solution:**
```bash
chmod +x quick-perf-test.sh
chmod +x run-performance-tests.sh
```

### Issue 3: "No tests found" or "Cannot find symbol"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure dependencies are installed
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

### Issue 4: Maven not found
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if Maven is installed
mvn --version

# If not installed, install it (macOS):
brew install maven
```

### Issue 5: NullPointerException during test initialization
This was previously caused by the API key not being available during Gatling class initialization. The fix uses `PerformanceConfig.getWeatherApiKey()` which evaluates at runtime.

If you still see this:
1. Make sure you've pulled the latest code
2. Clean and recompile: `mvn clean compile test-compile`
3. Ensure WEATHER_API_KEY is exported BEFORE running Maven

## 📊 Different Test Configurations

Remember: Always set `export WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key` first for Weather API tests!

### Quick Test (30 seconds, 5 users)
```bash
export WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key
mvn gatling:test \
  -Dgatling.simulationClass=com.example.performance.simulations.WeatherApiPerformanceSimulation \
  -Dperf.users=5 \
  -Dperf.duration=30
```

### Load Test (1 minute, 10 users)
```bash
export WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key
mvn gatling:test \
  -Dgatling.simulationClass=com.example.performance.simulations.WeatherApiPerformanceSimulation \
  -Dperf.users=10 \
  -Dperf.duration=60 \
  -Dperf.type=load
```

### Stress Test (2 minutes, 50 users)
```bash
export WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key
mvn gatling:test \
  -Dgatling.simulationClass=com.example.performance.simulations.WeatherApiPerformanceSimulation \
  -Dperf.users=50 \
  -Dperf.duration=120 \
  -Dperf.type=stress
```

### Spike Test (sudden burst of 100 users)
```bash
export WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key
mvn gatling:test \
  -Dgatling.simulationClass=com.example.performance.simulations.WeatherApiPerformanceSimulation \
  -Dperf.users=100 \
  -Dperf.type=spike
```

### E-commerce API Test
```bash
# E-commerce API doesn't require WEATHER_API_KEY
mvn gatling:test \
  -Dgatling.simulationClass=com.example.performance.simulations.EcommerceApiPerformanceSimulation \
  -Dperf.users=10
```

## 🎯 Using the Full Script

If you want to use the full `run-performance-tests.sh` script:

```bash
# Set API key first (for Weather API tests)
export WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key

# Make sure it's executable
chmod +x run-performance-tests.sh

# View help
./run-performance-tests.sh --help

# Run tests
./run-performance-tests.sh weather-api
./run-performance-tests.sh -u 20 -t stress weather-api
./run-performance-tests.sh -u 30 -r 20 -d 120 weather-api
```

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

### 1. Check if dependencies are installed
```bash
mvn dependency:tree | grep gatling
```

### 2. Check if API key is set (CRITICAL!)
```bash
echo $WEATHER_API_KEY
# Should output your_api_key (or a non-empty value)
```

### 3. Check if Maven can compile
```bash
mvn clean test-compile -DskipTests
```

### 4. Run a simple test
```bash
export WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key
./quick-perf-test.sh
```

---

## 📈 What Happens During the Test

1. Environment variable check — tests verify WEATHER_API_KEY is set
2. Maven downloads dependencies (first time only)
3. Code compilation — tests compile successfully
4. Gatling starts and creates virtual users
5. Users make API calls to Weather API with your key
6. Metrics are collected (response times, throughput, errors)
7. HTML report is generated in `target/gatling-results/`
8. Report opens automatically in your browser

---

## 📊 Understanding the Results

After the test completes, you'll see output like:
```
================================================================================
---- Global Information --------------------------------------------------------
> request count                                         50 (OK=50     KO=0     )
> min response time                                     18 (OK=18     KO=-     )
> max response time                                    105 (OK=105    KO=-     )
> mean response time                                    38 (OK=38     KO=-     )
> response time 95th percentile                         83 (OK=83     KO=-     )
> response time 99th percentile                        101 (OK=101    KO=-     )
================================================================================
```

Key Metrics:
- ✅ OK: Successful requests
- ❌ KO: Failed requests (should be 0)
- Mean: Average response time (lower is better)
- P95: 95% of requests were faster than this
- P99: 99% of requests were faster than this

---

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know the test succeeded when:
- ✅ No "WEATHER_API_KEY is not set" error
- ✅ Maven completes with `BUILD SUCCESS`
- ✅ All requests show `OK` (no failures)
- ✅ HTML report is generated
- ✅ Report opens in your browser automatically

---

## 📞 Quick Troubleshooting

If the test fails:
1. ⚠️ FIRST: Check API key is set: `echo $WEATHER_API_KEY`
2. Check Maven is installed: `mvn --version`
3. Check dependencies: `mvn clean install -DskipTests`
4. Try the simple script: `./quick-perf-test.sh`
5. Try direct Maven command (see section above)

If you see compilation errors:
```bash
mvn clean compile test-compile -DskipTests
```

If report doesn't open:
```bash
# Find and open manually
find target/gatling-results -name "index.html" -type f -exec open {} \;
```

---

## 🚀 Next Steps After Successful Test

1. ✅ View the HTML report (opens automatically)
2. 📊 Review the metrics and charts
3. 🔄 Run more tests with different configurations
4. 📈 Track performance over time
5. 🎯 Customize simulations for your needs

---

## 🔐 Important Notes

### API Key Requirements:
- Local Development: set `export WEATHER_API_KEY=...` before running tests
- GitHub Actions: typically provided from repository secrets
- Configuration: uses `PerformanceConfig.getWeatherApiKey()` which validates at runtime

### How It Works:
1. `PerformanceConfig.getWeatherApiKey()` checks for the key in this order:
   - Environment variable `WEATHER_API_KEY`
   - System property `-DWEATHER_API_KEY=...`
   - Configuration file (fallback)
2. If not found, throws `IllegalStateException` with clear error message
3. Gatling simulation uses the retrieved key for all API calls

```bash

Good luck! 🎉
