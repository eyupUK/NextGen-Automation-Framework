## 🚀 Available Test Types

You can now run different types of performance tests:

### 1. Load Test (Default)
```bash
./run-performance-tests.sh weather-api
```
Simulates expected traffic to validate normal performance.

### 2. Stress Test
```bash
./run-performance-tests.sh -u 50 -t stress weather-api
```
Pushes system beyond normal capacity to find breaking points.

### 3. Spike Test
```bash
./run-performance-tests.sh -u 100 -t spike weather-api
```
Tests sudden traffic bursts and system recovery.

### 4. Custom Configuration
```bash
./run-performance-tests.sh -u 30 -r 20 -d 120 weather-api
```
Run with 30 users, 20-second ramp-up, 2-minute duration.

### 5. E-commerce API Test
```bash
./run-performance-tests.sh ecommerce-api
```
Tests multiple e-commerce scenarios (browse, cart, auth).
