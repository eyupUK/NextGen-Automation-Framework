# 🎉 GitHub Actions - Performance Testing Setup Complete!

## ✅ What Was Created

I've created **4 comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows** for automated performance testing in your CI/CD pipeline.

---

## 📁 Files Created

All workflow files are now in `.github/workflows/`:

1. **`performance-tests.yml`** - Main flexible performance testing workflow
2. **`nightly-performance.yml`** - Automated nightly comprehensive tests
3. **`pr-performance.yml`** - Quick PR performance validation
4. **`stress-test.yml`** - Intensive stress and spike testing
5. **`docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS_PERFORMANCE.md`** - Complete documentation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Your First GitHub Actions Performance Test

**Option 1: Via GitHub UI**
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to **Actions** tab
3. Select **"Performance Tests"**
4. Click **"Run workflow"**
5. Choose parameters:
   - Test Type: `load`
   - Users: `10`
   - Duration: `60`
   - Simulation: `weather`
6. Click **"Run workflow"** button

**Option 2: Via GitHub CLI**
```bash

## 📊 Workflow Overview

### 1. Performance Tests (Main Workflow)
**File:** `.github/workflows/performance-tests.yml`

✅ **Flexible & Customizable**
- Manual trigger with parameters
- Weekly scheduled run (Sundays 2 AM)
- Choose test type: Load, Stress, or Spike
- Select API: Weather, E-commerce, or both
- Configure users and duration

✅ **Features:**
- Runs both Gatling and JUnit tests
- Generates HTML reports with charts
- Exports CSV metrics
- Posts results to PR comments
- Creates performance summary
- Archives reports (30-90 days)

**Example Usage:**
```bash
# Load test with 20 users for 2 minutes
gh workflow run performance-tests.yml \
  -f test_type=load \
  -f users=20 \
  -f duration=120 \
  -f simulation=all
```

---

### 2. Nightly Performance Tests
**File:** `.github/workflows/nightly-performance.yml`

🌙 **Automated Daily Testing**
- Runs automatically every night at 2 AM UTC
- Extended tests: 5 minutes, 20 users
- Tracks performance trends (365 days)
- Creates issues on failure
- Baseline comparison

✅ **Perfect For:**
- Continuous monitoring
- Long-term trend analysis
- Early detection of regressions
- Establishing baselines

---

### 3. PR Performance Check
**File:** `.github/workflows/pr-performance.yml`

🔀 **Automatic PR Validation**
- Triggers on PRs to main/master/develop
- Quick 30-second test (5 users)
- Comments results on PR
- Non-blocking (informational)

✅ **Benefits:**
- Catches performance regressions early
- No manual intervention needed
- Lightweight and fast
- Provides immediate feedback

**Example PR Comment:**
```
🎯 Performance Test Results

Quick Performance Check Completed

Configuration:
- Users: 5
- Duration: 30 seconds
- Test Type: Load

Results:
✅ Performance test executed successfully

Next Steps:
1. Download the artifacts to view detailed reports
2. Compare metrics with baseline
3. Ensure no significant performance regression
```

---

### 4. Stress Test Suite
**File:** `.github/workflows/stress-test.yml`

🔥 **Intensive Testing**
- Manual trigger only (resource-intensive)
- Stress test: Push beyond normal capacity
- Spike test: Sudden traffic bursts
- Configurable max users (default: 100)
- Extended duration (default: 3 minutes)

✅ **Use Cases:**
- Capacity planning
- Finding system limits
- Testing auto-scaling
- Breaking point analysis

**Example Usage:**
```bash
# Stress test with 100 users for 5 minutes
gh workflow run stress-test.yml \
  -f max_users=100 \
  -f duration=300
```

| **Gatling HTML Reports** | Interactive charts, graphs, percentiles | 30-90 days | ~5-10 MB |
| **JUnit Results** | Test results, logs, stack traces | 30 days | ~1-2 MB |
| **CSV Metrics** | Exportable performance data | 90-365 days | <1 MB |
| **Performance Trends** | Long-term tracking data | 365 days | <1 MB |

### How to Access:
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on a completed workflow run

### 3. Regular Reviews
- 📅 Check nightly test results daily
- 📅 Review trends weekly
- 📅 Analyze regressions immediately
- 📅 Update baselines quarterly

### 4. Manage Artifacts
- 🗄️ Download important reports locally
- 🗄️ Set appropriate retention periods
- 🗄️ Archive critical results externally
- 🗄️ Clean up old artifacts regularly

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Running?
- ✅ Check if Actions are enabled in repo settings
- ✅ Verify workflow file syntax (YAML)
- ✅ Ensure branch protection allows workflows

### Tests Failing?
- ✅ Check API availability and rate limits
- ✅ Verify credentials in configuration.properties
- ✅ Review logs in workflow run details
- ✅ Reduce user count if needed

### Artifacts Not Available?
- ✅ Verify workflow completed successfully
- ✅ Check file paths in upload action
- ✅ Ensure artifacts within size limits (2GB max)
